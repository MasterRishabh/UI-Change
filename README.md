# UI-Change
Contains the file that needs change

Unzip both of them.
CardsView.zip : It has index.html that you can directly open in browser to see the UI.
alpha.zip : After unzip , I hope you have node.js installed then just navigate to unzipped folder then,
                1. Run "npm install"  to install the dependencies
                2.Run "npm start" to fire up the server
                3.Visit localhost:3000 in your browser

What will you observe, is that cards are not showing the same for alpha as it is showing in cardsView. Why it is not applying the effects , can you help in identifying it ?
